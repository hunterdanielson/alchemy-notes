- Object Literals
    - Objects model things you'd see in the real world using variables and functions
    - Access object information using the dot notation:
    object.property
- Document Object Model
    - The DOM tree is a model of the web page
    - Only getElementById('id') and querySelector('css selector) select one element at a time
    - All others return a nodelist, which is accessed like an array or using .item() method
    - There are only 4 types of nodes:
        - document
        - element
        - attribute
        - text
