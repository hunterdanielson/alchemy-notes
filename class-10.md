## JavaScript Book
- Error Handling & Debugging
    - Order of execution: the order in which events happen
    - Understand the stack of code
    - Scope is lexical scope in JavaScript: binded to the object defined within
    - Many different errors, they are our friends, they tell us what's wrong
    - Different browsers have different dev tools
    - Breakpoints:
        - allow one to pause execution of a script at any point 
        - one can check variable contents
        - can proceed one step at a time
    - Try, Catch, Finally
        - Try runs until it encounters an error and passes control to catch
        - Catch then runs, it is most often used to alert the user when something has gone wrong
        - Finally runs when the error is resolved
